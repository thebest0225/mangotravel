# MangoTravel

## Overview

MangoTravel is a family-focused travel planning application built with React, Express, and TypeScript. The app allows families to create, manage, and track travel plans with features including flight information, daily schedules, essential item checklists, and place recommendations with Google Maps integration for travel time calculations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and bundling

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between client and server
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store

### Project Structure
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express backend API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and schemas
- `migrations/` - Database migration files

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses three main entities:
- **Travel Plans**: Core planning entity with title, dates, participants, status, flight info, and essential items
- **Schedule Items**: Daily schedule entries linked to travel plans with time, location, duration details
- **Saved Places**: User-saved locations with categories, ratings, and descriptions

### API Structure
RESTful API with the following main endpoints:
- `/api/travel-plans` - CRUD operations for travel plans
- `/api/travel-plans/:id/schedule` - Schedule management for specific plans
- `/api/saved-places` - Place management and search functionality

### Storage Layer
- **Interface**: `IStorage` interface defining all data operations
- **Implementation**: `DatabaseStorage` class using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless provider for persistent data storage

### UI Components
- **Layout Components**: Header with navigation, bottom navigation with floating action button
- **Travel Components**: Plan cards, flight info display, daily schedule management, essentials checklist
- **Form Components**: Comprehensive form handling for plan creation and editing

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with React components
2. **State Management**: TanStack Query manages API calls and caching
3. **API Communication**: HTTP requests to Express server endpoints
4. **Validation**: Zod schemas validate data on both client and server
5. **Storage**: Data persisted through storage interface (memory or database)
6. **Response**: Data flows back through the same path with automatic UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, React DOM, React Router via Wouter)
- Express.js for server framework
- TypeScript for type safety across the stack

### Database and ORM
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connectivity

### UI and Styling
- Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Development Tools
- Vite for fast development and building
- ESBuild for server-side bundling
- TSX for TypeScript execution in development

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Backend**: TSX for direct TypeScript execution
- **Database**: In-memory storage for quick development iteration

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Environment Configuration
- Development mode uses Vite middleware for frontend serving
- Production mode serves static files from Express
- Database connection automatically switches based on environment
- Replit-specific optimizations for cloud deployment

The application is designed to be easily deployable on Replit with automatic environment detection and configuration.
